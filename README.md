[BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com/app/apiOverview) (non-official) client for rust, with async/await support!

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/bitmex)

## Caveat

Please run the tests before you use since BitMEX often introduces breaking changes without
changing their Swagger API definition.

Also, the Swagger definition somehow is not aligned with BitMEX's realworld API. Since bitmex-rs
auto-generates the code from swagger.json, you may experience some API breakage. Please do not 
hesitate to file an issue!

## Usage

Add this to your Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
bitmex = "0.2"
```

# Basic usage

```rust
// This will give you a BitMEX instance, which the only purpose is to create connection.
let bm = bitmex::BitMEXRest::with_credential(&std::env::var("BITMEX_KEY")?, &std::env::var("BITMEX_SECRET")?);

// All the requests to BitMEX server afterwards will go through HTTP Restful API.

// The request models reside in "bitmex::models" module, with the
// naming convention of "Method+camelCase(endpoint)+Request", e.g. "GET /trade/bucketed" would be
// "bitmex::models::GetTradeBucketedRequest" in bitmex-rs.
let req = bitmex::models::GetTradeBucketedRequest {
    bin_size: Some(bitmex::models::BinSize::D1),
    ..Default::default()
};

// Request to BitMEX server is made by giving "BitMEX::request" the request object.
// The return type of "BitMEX::request" is a future of the response so that you can await on it.
let resp = bm.request(req).await?;
println!("Bucketed trades: {:?}", resp);  

// A websocket is created by "BitMEX::websocket".
let mut ws = bm.websocket().await?;

// The websocket is a duplex channel which means you can send "bitmex::websocket::Command" to BitMEX and 
// receive "bitmex::websocket::Message" from BitMEX using it.
let expires = (Utc::now() + Duration::seconds(30)).timestamp();
ws.send(Command::authenticate(&bm, expires).unwrap()).await?;

// In order to get the ws messages, just poll the ws stream.
while let Some(message) = ws.next().await {
    println!("Subscription message received {:?}", message);
}

```

## Implementation status

Currently all the API features are implemented, including websocket!
